    <p>
      At Beyond the Belt's Martial Arts Leadership Program, we go far beyond kicking and punching. We focus on character building, and school and street safety. Students learn practical martial arts and gain skills in an 
      encouraging environment. We use goal setting as a key to the childâ€™s success, and each student gets individual attention, gets challenged, and gets encouraged. 
      <br><br>
      The course focuses around exercises, mat chats, and martial arts training.
      <br><br>
      <strong><u>Exercise:</u></strong>
      <br><br>
      Each child works on their physical goals for push-ups, crunches, and squats. The focus is on form and doing the exercise well (Habits we train are habits we gain!). Each student is encouraged to set their own goals 
      and exceed them. 
      <br><br>
      <strong><u>Mat Chats</u></strong>
      <br><br>
      Mat chats are inspirational talks given in each class. The 1st part of a mat chat is always about character development, including self discipline (doing what you know you're supposed to, even if you don't want to), 
      positive attitudes (having a "whatever it takes attitude," an "attitude of gratitude", etc.), and more. The focus is on training the mind as well as the body.
      <br><br>
      The second part of a mat chat is around school safety and life skills. This includes the ABCs of conflict (how to Avoid, how to Be calm, and how to Communicate), stranger danger, and other street safety topics. Life 
      skills are also imparted such as how to greet people, make friends, and have good interaction skills that breed confidence.
      <br><br>
      <strong><u>Martial Arts Training:</u></strong>
      <br><br>
      Each week consists of a different focus in a rotating curriculum to help maximize learning potential for each student.<br><br><strong>At a beginner level,</strong> students are learning basics such as punching, 
      kicking techniques, basic defense, and bag work. During this phase, they are being taught how to work well with others , how to use their strengths to help others weaknesses, and above all, they are working on their 
      ability to focus!
      <br><br>
      Once a student has graduated the beginner program, they move to the&nbsp;<strong>advanced classes</strong>. These classes teach ground defense, improved technique, and more advanced partner drills. Students are 
      taught to hone their leadership skills and pursue martial arts with excellence.
      <br><br>
      The program is for kids ages 4-16 (4 and 5 year olds receive separate instruction). It is based on participation twice a week, but with multiple class times that fit your schedule. Classes are 45 minutes long. 
      <br><br>
      We pride ourselves on providing a safe, welcoming, and encouraging environment and making a positive impact on young people through teaching martial arts.
